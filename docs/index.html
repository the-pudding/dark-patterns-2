                <p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What is a dark pattern? Dark patterns are design patterns that unintentionally or intentionally trick people into making decisions they normally wouldn’t make. Have you ever signed up for an email listserve and decided to unsubscribe only to discover days later you’re still signed up? That’s a dark pattern. Have you ever opened an online news site in the EU and seen a series of pop ups asking if you agree or not? That’s the GDPR and it was riddled with dark patterns. Or perhaps you’ve been shopping on a website, and seen a countdown timer reminding you a sale is about to end, or seen a little ticker above the item you’re clicking on that it’s low in stock? All of those, depending upon how they’re shown to you, are dark patterns.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Dark patterns can be easy, and difficult to spot, regardless of your own technical prowess. The editors, writers, designers and technologists working on this article have all fallen for dark patterns, and we even study them. <a target=_blank href=https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/dark-patterns/>Princeton University ran a study in 2019</a> where they crawled over 11,000 e-commerce and shopping sites and found 1,818 dark patterns. Those 1,818 were present on 1,254 of the 11,00 shopping websites, which is about 11.1% of sites they looked at. The research also found that “shopping websites that were more popular, according to Alexa rankings, were more likely to feature dark patterns.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

        </div><div class="section svelte-2acxjy">

                <p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->This article focuses on the dark patterns that occur from a common place in consumers’ lives: signing up for a service or a product, and then deciding to cancel. Canceling subscriptions or products, or accidentally being signed up for a subscription without realizing it, or forgetting about a free trial that then turns into a paid trial, is a really common occurrence across digital products. Not all of those experiences have dark patterns, but a lot do. I decided to explore how easy it was to sign up for a service, and see what kinds of malicious, confusing or deceitful behaviors occurred afterwards.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->From August 2 to October 4, 2022, I signed up for 16 different websites or products and started to map out what problems occurred, like: encountering dark patterns or frictions from canceling, which websites reminded me (or didn’t) when a free trial lapsed, if I could get refunded from a subscription, and then mapping out how much time and money I lost trying to unsubscribe from those products, services or systems. I purposefully selected well-known and common websites or websites that had been identified by experts as having ‘dark patterns.’<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I analyzed:<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Amazon Subscribe and Save<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Ancestry.com<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Vimeo<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Paramount<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Netflix<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Hulu<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Adobe<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Savage Fenty<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->New York Times.com<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->BostonGlobe.com<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Daily Harvest<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Deliveroo<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Care2Petition<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Express VPN<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
        </div>

    <div class="section svelte-2acxjy">

                <p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In total, I lost: $330.60 and 57 minutes and 31 seconds trying to unsubscribe.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Across, the 16 websites, I encountered 20 instances dark patterns. But all of the websites engaged in bad or confusing tactics at some point, even after successfully un-subscribing.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Every website resulted in lost money but the only one that refunded me was Adobe, from a lack of reminders of when free trials ended, to being locked into longer, annual subscriptions, adding extra steps for confirmation (where it felt like we had unsubscribed but there was one more click to actually confirm) or hiding when a trial exactly ended.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
        </div><div class="section svelte-2acxjy">

                <p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The websites that took the longest to cancel subscriptions were the ones that required phone calls: the New York Times took 17 minutes and 36 seconds to cancel, and the Boston Globe took 3 phone calls; with phone call 1 clocking in at 3 minutes and 32 seconds, phone call 2 at 30 seconds and the last phone call at 6 minutes, 34 seconds. The Boston Globe was undergoing technical difficulties in order to cancel, hence the three phone calls. Savage Fenty required either a phone call or taking a person via a chat interface online, which took 7 minutes.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->So, the other ways to cancel were faster, right? Not necessarily! The time to cancel was varied. Some websites had a very non-dark pattern, and a straightforward way to cancel, which took under 1 minute to cancel, like Netflix, Hulu and Paramount +. Websites, like ExpressVPN, once I googled ‘how to cancel’, took 55 seconds. But, the ExpressVPN process was riddled with dark patterns- the canceling process was called ‘auto-renew’ and there wasn’t any documentation in their FAQ on how to cancel. BY having to Google on how to cancel, that itself, is also a dark pattern.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->However, other processes like canceling Amazon Auto-Subscription took four minutes to cancel.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
        </div><div class="section svelte-2acxjy">

                <p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->And I encountered a lot of friction.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Nearly all had confirm-shaming (please stay! Are you sure you want to leave?) and some, like Paramount +, Adobe, offered discounts and deals instead of canceling. Some cancellation processes took multiple steps, including extra steps like having to confirm multiple times that I wanted to cancel, but some buried their cancellation processes deep in their websites that were difficult to find. A few, like ExpressVPN, Daily Harvest and Vimeo, called their cancellation processes ‘auto-renew’, adding to confusion.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

    <div class="section svelte-2acxjy">

                <p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->However, the most egregious one: Vimeo.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What makes Vimeo the most egregious is both the amount of dark patterns, the kinds of dark patterns, and that it locks consumers into a year long account that isn’t refunded, but it’s presented as a monthly account. Harry Brignull’s Deceptive Design Patterns/Dark Patterns twitter account found something similar <a target=_blank href=https://twitter.com/darkpatterns/status/1489901640777973768>that Adobe had done</a> back in February 2022, which Adobe has now changed. Back in February 2022, internet users noticed that Adobe had tricked users into a similar 12 month long contract, but would offer only partial refunds. Adobe, like Vimeo, tricked users into signing up for year-long contracts. Vimeo takes it a step further by also adding numerous steps to even unsubscribe, and in the sign up interface, attempting to hide the free version of the product.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Over the phone, Dr Jen King, Stanford University fellow, described the multiple issues with these kinds of dark patterns, which is proportionality, clear clarity for users in terms of what kinds of subscriptions they are signing up for, and that there’s no real reason to make it difficult to unsubscribe. “The the key concept that I keep seeing discussed is proportionality- that it shouldn't be disproportionately harder to cancel, as opposed to signing up for something…Most of these digital services, there's no provisioning overhead…they're not bearing any costs by you canceling other than you know, depriving them of that revenue.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->King pointed out that the part of the issue is companies framing this as a subscription when it seems to be more of a contract. King further iterated, “ it’s that concept of a contract versus a subscription. The fact that they think that you're on the hook for the whole year just because you didn't hit the cancel button in this free trial,” is part of the problem. Part of the issues with dark patterns is this gray area of ‘clarity’-- there was fine print for Vimeo when I rooted around for it– but so much of the interface in the sign up flow had pre-selected the year long ‘subscription’. Any normal users would have had to really read in-depth of what they were signing up for and take a lot of extra effort to unselect those choices. Compare this to the 14 other examples- none of those accidentally signed me up for an entire year. While Ancestry.com has a similar year long contract, it wasn’t guiding users to a pre-selected year long contract subscription. Additionally, <a target=_blank href=https://points.datasociety.net/dark-patterns-and-design-policy-75d1a71fbda5>I noted one of Vimeo’s dark patterns back in 2020, the hiding of the free account,</a> and it still hasn’t been changed. All of this is what makes Vimeo such an egregious actor with multiple dark patterns.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

    <div class="section svelte-2acxjy">

                <p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What are the Issues with Dark Patterns, Really?<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Dark patterns, manipulative design, and confusing design have a multiplicity of harms, including impacting consumers decision making and behaviors, along with affecting competition and markets.  Over a video conference call, Andreas Jespersen, the Interim Director for the CMA’s Behavioral Hub, unpacked why this is a concern for the CMA. “Our worry is that if you're a large, firm, and you own many sort of different and interconnected types of businesses, so if you own both a in a browser and a phone for instance, or you own a, you develop computers and games… we think you can use choice architecture to guide consumers from one part of your product to product the most interesting and then to other parts of product giving subsets of your business an unfair advantage over competitors who don't have that initial ability to guide consumers by having owning the device or owning the platform or whatever,” he explained.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It has to be looked at in terms of understanding fairness, advantages and disadvantages, along with unfair price advantages that can harm a lot of consumers and affect pricing. “From the viewpoint of the individual consumer, the largest problem with choice architecture or dark patterns is basically its ability to stop or unduly influence your decisions when you're online. We know from research that these types of dark patterns such as architecture can make you buy stuff at a high price. They can keep you on for longer than you wanted in a subscription; they can make you give up more data than you initially wanted. And all of these effects are basically even if the magnitude of the harm is enormous, in combination, and with the presence of many of these practices online there, is there a substantial risk of sort of consumer detriment if we are continuously exposed to these things? Obviously,” Jepsersen stated.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->At present, the CMA has done a variety of studies and use cases, including two that are focused on subscriptions. For example, they worked with PlayStation and found that it was difficult for consumers to understand what they signed up for and consumers felt they'd stayed on longer than they wanted to. Jepsersen explained how the CMA worked with the company to reach an agreement that they would change their security practices to sort of better accommodate the choice architecture to how the consumers naturally interacted with the subscriptions.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But, also importantly, I would argue that user frustration, wasted time and money are pretty big harms. University of Washington Law professor Ryan Calo has argued that dark patterns <a target=_blank href=http://www.gwlr.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Calo_82_41.pdf>can result in three kinds of harm typologies</a>: economic harm, privacy harm and vulnerability as autonomy harm. Similarly, the same <a target=_blank href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04843.pdf>authors behind the Princeton E-commerce study,</a> found similar harms but with cognitive burden instead of vulnerability as autonomy.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What’s important to remember, and consider, with dark patterns, is not to view this as an individualistic threat, but one against large groups of people. It doesn’t matter if you personally were not tricked or weren’t mad at the interaction but it matters that the interaction themselves are happening, and that they are designed to target users, corporate our user agency, and impact our choices. It also matters how prevalent dark patterns are, too. A <a target=_blank href=https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/606365bc-d58b-11ec-a95f-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-257599418>European Union commissioned report on dark patterns</a> found “97% of the most popular websites and apps used by EU consumers deployed at least one dark pattern. Dark patterns don’t have to be a norm of the web, even if they have become so prevalent right now.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Dark patterns don’t affect all users equally- users that speak different languages, or are in a foreign country, or are new to technology, are disproportionately affected by dark patterns. That same European Union report found that “vulnerable consumers were more likely to make inconsistent choices (50.89%) than average consumers (47.24%) when exposed to dark patterns. Their report and experiment tested 7,000 European Union based netizens across different language blocs. Equally important, their found dark patterns are easier to spot if you know what they are or have a background in user experience design. A person shouldn’t have to be a UX designer to navigate the web just to avoid dark patterns, confusion and manipulation. That isn’t a fair web.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Easy To Unsubscribe as Subscribe<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Across conversations with different experts, researchers and regulators, this is a refrain I hear again and again, given how low the barrier is to engage with something, it should be equally low to nullify that dark pattern. This is something researchers against dark patterns advocate for, with Access Now and the Web Foundation’s forthcoming ‘Dos and Dont’s of Deceptive Design,’ along with dark patterns experts like Jen King, mentioned above. It should be easy to unsubscribe as it is to subscribe, something <a target=_blank href=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-ramp-enforcement-against-illegal-dark-patterns-trick-or-trap-consumers-subscriptions>the FTC is focusing on in terms</a> of their own dark patterns work and investigations. Shopify has even published an article on <a target=_blank href=https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/dark-patterns>12 Dark Patterns to avoid</a> for product designers, with nearly identical advice to don’t do this, except they call this practice the ‘roach motel.’<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Dark Patterns Regulation Exists and More is Coming<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What can be done about dark patterns? We are entering an era of dark patterns related to regulation, and investigation.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In the EU, regulators like the <a target=_blank href=https://www.forbrukerradet.no/dark-patterns/>Norwegian Consumer Council</a> have been focusing on dark patterns and their harms since 2018, along with regulation like the <a target=_blank href=https://techpolicy.press/do-the-dsa-and-dma-have-what-it-takes-to-take-on-dark-patterns/>EU’s Digital Markets Act with two articles focused on dark patterns and the Digital Services Act mentioning dark patterns in their provisional text</a>. Different regulators found various dark patterns in the EU’s GDPR to be against the law itself, violating user consent and co-opting user privacy, resulting in fines. Other regulators, like the <a target=_blank href=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-choice-architecture-how-digital-design-can-harm-competition-and-consumers>UK’s Competitions and Markets Authority</a> are investigating dark patterns to see if these design based confusion and manipulative patterns affect fair competition. Jespersen emphasized, “[the CMA] wants to use the full extent of our powers to go through consumer enforcement if we find appropriate problems.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Even in the US, dark patterns related regulation is ramping up, with <a target=_blank href=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-ramp-enforcement-against-illegal-dark-patterns-trick-or-trap-consumers-subscriptions>the FTC vowing to ramp up enforcement on dark patterns that trick or trap users into subscriptions</a> in 2021, and <a target=_blank href=https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/07/thanks-to-california-a-news-site-or-other-business-now-has-to-let-you-cancel-your-subscription-online/>California’s state law in 2018</a> mentioning dark patterns. <a target=_blank href=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/11/ftc-action-against-vonage-results-100-million-customers-trapped-illegal-dark-patterns-junk-fees-when-trying-cancel-service>In early November, the FTC fined phone service provider Vonage $100 million dollars for cancellation based dark patterns</a>. Vonage’s dark patterns were identical to some of the dark patterns I found for this article.  Via a court order, the FTC’s <a target=_blank href=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/11/ftc-action-against-vonage-results-100-million-customers-trapped-illegal-dark-patterns-junk-fees-when-trying-cancel-service>has gotten Vonage to agree to simplify their cancellation process and to explicitly stop using dark patterns.</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->With this recent Vonage case, it’s clear the tide is changing. A user should not have to be a design expert to buy a <a target=_blank href=https://www.deceptive.design/types/hidden-costs>fair priced item or avoid hidden fees</a>, <a target=_blank href=https://www.deceptive.design/types/roach-motel>accidental subscriptions</a>, or <a target=_blank href=https://www.deceptive.design/types/privacy-zuckering>give up more of their data</a> without their choice. Difficult to find or access privacy settings on social networks is problematic, so is waiting 20 minutes to cancel a newspaper subscription and so additional fees from airlines that ultimately misrepresent the price. It might be personal what you or your community considers more problematic or harmful, but all dark patterns are problematic.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->To put this into context, what if every experiment of mine had resulted in 15 minutes of headache to unsubscribe, along with secret or hidden fees of hundreds of dollars of yearly subscriptions instead of monthly ones? 14 experiments would have resulted in over three and half hours of attempting to cancel, and double or triple the amount of money I lost.[a]<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->If a consumer went to a physical store and bought an item that came with a secret hidden fee and a subscription difficult to cancel, consumers would be outraged.[b]<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->This is also something King echoed, “You have as a consumer, the right to cancel something, to not want to spend your money in a particular way and to act somehow, just because they can control the entire kind of digital environment in which you're doing business that you don't somehow have those rights is is just fundamentally wrong.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-2acxjy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It's the trickery and subterge of dark patterns that make them feel emotionally insidious. But regardless, economic harm, privacy harm, one’s vulnerability being targeted and manipulated along with the cognitive burden of navigating dark patterns, is what makes dark patterns writ large such an urgent issue. Outside of the U.S., these kinds of harms are seen as urgent legal issues, where European consumers have a right to data protection and consumer protection. But, all people, regardless of which country they live in, deserve to live on an internet where their time and money are not wasted, and their privacy is not compromised simply because a product or company can trick them.[c]<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
