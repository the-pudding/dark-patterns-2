The fact that they think that you're on the hook for the whole year just because you didn't hit the cancel button in this free trial,” is part of the problem. Part of the issues with dark patterns is this gray area of ‘clarity’-- there was fine print for Vimeo when I rooted around for it– but so much of the interface in the sign up flow had pre-selected the year long ‘subscription’. Any normal users would have had to really read in-depth of what they were signing up for and take a lot of extra effort to unselect those choices. Compare this to the 14 other examples- none of those accidentally signed me up for an entire year. While Ancestry.com has a similar year long contract, it wasn’t guiding users to a pre-selected year long contract subscription.

We know from research that these types of dark patterns such as architecture can make you buy stuff at a high price. They can keep you on for longer than you wanted in a subscription; they can make you give up more data than you initially wanted. And all of these effects are basically even if the magnitude of the harm is enormous, in combination, and with the presence of many of these practices online there, is there a substantial risk of sort of consumer detriment if we are continuously exposed to these things? Obviously,” Jepsersen stated."},{type:"text",value:"At present, the CMA has done a variety of studies and use cases, including two that are focused on subscriptions. For example, they worked with PlayStation and found that it was difficult for consumers to understand what they signed up for and consumers felt they'd stayed on longer than they wanted to. Jepsersen explained how the CMA worked with the company to reach an agreement that they would change their security practices to sort of better accommodate the choice architecture to how the consumers naturally interacted with the subscriptions."},{type:"text",value:"But, also importantly, I would argue that user frustration, wasted time and money are pretty big harms. University of Washington Law professor Ryan Calo has argued that dark patterns <a target=_blank href=http://www.gwlr.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Calo_82_41.pdf>can result in three kinds of harm typologies</a>: economic harm, privacy harm and vulnerability as autonomy harm.

It doesn’t matter if you personally were not tricked or weren’t mad at the interaction but it matters that the interaction themselves are happening, and that they are designed to target users, corporate our user agency, and impact our choices. It also matters how prevalent dark patterns are, too.

That same European Union report found that “vulnerable consumers were more likely to make inconsistent choices (50.89%) than average consumers (47.24%) when exposed to dark patterns. Their report and experiment tested 7,000 European Union based netizens across different language blocs. Equally important, their found dark patterns are easier to spot if you know what they are or have a background in user experience design.
