Over a video conference call, Andreas Jespersen, the Interim Director for the CMA’s Behavioral Hub, unpacked why this is a concern for the CMA. “Our worry is that if you're a large, firm, and you own many sort of different and interconnected types of businesses, so if you own both a in a browser and a phone for instance, or you own a, you develop computers and games… we think you can use choice architecture to guide consumers from one part of your product to product the most interesting and then to other parts of product giving subsets of your business an unfair advantage over competitors who don't have that initial ability to guide consumers by having owning the device or owning the platform or whatever,” he explained."},{"type":"text","value":"It has to be looked at in terms of understanding fairness, advantages and disadvantages, along with unfair price advantages that can harm a lot of consumers and affect pricing. “From the viewpoint of the individual consumer, the largest problem with choice architecture or dark patterns is basically its ability to stop or unduly influence your decisions when you're online. We know from research that these types of dark patterns such as architecture can make you buy stuff at a high price. They can keep you on for longer than you wanted in a subscription; they can make you give up more data than you initially wanted. And all of these effects are basically even if the magnitude of the harm is enormous, in combination, and with the presence of many of these practices online there, is there a substantial risk of sort of consumer detriment if we are continuously exposed to these things? Obviously,” Jepsersen stated."},{"type":"text","value":"At present, the CMA has done a variety of studies and use cases, including two that are focused on subscriptions. For example, they worked with PlayStation and found that it was difficult for consumers to understand what they signed up for and consumers felt they'd stayed on longer than they wanted to. Jepsersen explained how the CMA worked with the company to reach an agreement that they would change their security practices to sort of better accommodate the choice architecture to how the consumers naturally interacted with the subscriptions."},{"type":"text","value":"But, also importantly, I would argue that user frustration, wasted time and money are pretty big harms. University of Washington Law professor Ryan Calo has argued that dark patterns <a target=_blank href=http://www.gwlr.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Calo_82_41.pdf>can result in three kinds of harm typologies</a>: economic harm, privacy harm and vulnerability as autonomy harm. Similarly, the same <a target=_blank href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04843.pdf>authors behind the Princeton E-commerce study,</a> found similar harms but with cognitive burden instead of vulnerability as autonomy."},{"type":"text","value":"What’s important to remember, and consider, with dark patterns, is not to view this as an individualistic threat, but one against large group —of people. It doesn’t matter if you personally were not tricked or weren’t mad at the interaction but it matters that the interaction themselves are happening, and that they are designed to target users, corporate our user agency, and impact our choices. It also matters how prevalent dark patterns are, too. A <a target=_blank href=https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/606365bc-d58b-11ec-a95f-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-257599418>European Union commissioned report on dark patterns</a> found “97% of the most popular websites and apps used by EU consumers deployed at least one dark pattern.

That same European Union report found that “vulnerable consumers were more likely to make inconsistent choices (50.89%) than average consumers (47.24%) when exposed to dark patterns. Their report and experiment tested 7,000 European Union based netizens across different language blocs. Equally important, their found dark patterns are easier to spot if you know what they are or have a background in user experience design.
